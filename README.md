## Requirements
* Linux OS(tested under CentOS)
* Docker

## Usage
* *Start a local kubernetes cluster when network is available*
```sh
cd minikube-on-linux
bash setup.sh start
```

* *Start a local kubernetes cluster when network is unavailable*
```sh
# make a offline installation package when network is available
# package will be saved in target directory
cd minikube-on-linux
bash setup.sh package
```
```sh
# start a local kubernetes cluster in private network
tar -xzvf minikube-on-linux.tar.gz
cd minikube-on-linux
bash setup.sh start
```
